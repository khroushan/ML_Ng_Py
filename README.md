# ML_Ng_Py
This repository includes many implementations of *Machine Learning*
algorithms and practical techniques. The main part is developed exactly
or around the assignment that has been given in Andrew Ng
Machine Learning course. Both jupyter notebooks and python
version of each part is included. In each part I try to test
my implementation from scratch against ML libraries such as
`sklearn-kit` and `Pytorch`. 

List of topics:
1. Linear Regression
2. Classification and Logistic Regression
3. Multi-class classification
4. Neural Network
