# Machine Learning

This repository includes many implementations of *Machine
Learning* algorithms and practical techniques. The main part
is developed around the assignment that has been given in
Andrew Ng Machine Learning course. Both jupyter notebooks
and python version of each part is included. In each section I
try to test my implementation against ML
libraries such as `sklearn-kit` and `Pytorch` if it is possible.

List of topics:
1. Linear Regression
2. Classification and Logistic Regression
3. Multi-class classification
4. Neural Network
5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
6. K-Mean Clustering
7. Principal Component Analysis
